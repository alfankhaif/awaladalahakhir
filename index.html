        I know sometimes overthinking can disturb our mood, I myself always overthink always try to keep loving you and think positive

      <pre style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">
        And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
        Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
        And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
        And well, maybe she's right, 'cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
        See, I honestly, don't even know why.
        Afraid to grow up
        
        I'm afraid I'm disappointed
        
        I afraid not as strong as I thought
        
        I'm still breathing
        Although often choked up
        
        I'm still breathing
        Even though I don't feel free
        
        Mid twenty-five
        
        How about next?
        
        Many buried dreams
        
        Sacrificing sleep
        
        I don't know what else I'm after
